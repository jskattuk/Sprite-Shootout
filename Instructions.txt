How to Play Sprite Shootout-by John Kattukudiyil. 
Hi, and welcome to Sprite Shootout! Allow me to explain the rules of this game.
Sprite Shootout pits two players against each other in a no-holds-barred shootout. Just pick your characters and a stage and you're all set!
Player 1 controls their sprite (the one on the left) by moving left, right, up and down with the A, D, W and S keys respectively. The spacebar is used to fire blasts.
Player 2 controls their sprite (the one on the left) with the left, right, up and down arrow keys, using the enter key to fire blasts.
The key of the game is to deplete your opponent's health before they deplete yours. This can be done by firing blasts at the opponent and lowering their health.
In terms of blasts, there are 3 kinds: Normal Blasts, Super Blasts and Hyper Blasts.
Normal Blasts can be fired regularly and do minimal damage. Super Blasts require a little bit of charging, but they do more damage output. 
Hyper Blasts require more charging time, but they make up for it in sheer damage.
And that's about all you need to know about Sprite Shootout. Thanks for playing, and have fun!
