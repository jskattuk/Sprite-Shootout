## What is Sprite Shootout?

Sprite Shootout is a 2-D based game I developed from scratch through the use of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in Java Swing. It is a player-vs.-player shooting match where the goal is simple: deplete your enemy's health before they deplete yours to win. A handful of characters and stages have been included to keep things fresh.

## How do I play?

The controls are pretty simple: Player 1 moves up, left, down, and right using the <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, and <kbd>D</kbd> keys respectively, and uses <kbd>Space</kbd> to fire blasts. Player 2 uses <kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>←</kbd>, <kbd>↓</kbd>, and <kbd>→</kbd> to move, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to fire blasts.

There are three types of blasts: Normal Blasts, Super Blasts, and Hyper Blasts. Normal Blasts can be fired regularly and do minimal damage. Super Blasts require a little bit of charging (hold the firing key to charge), but they are bigger and do more damage output. Hyper Blasts require more charging time, but they make up for it in sheer size and damage.

If you ever need help, just hit the "How To Play" button on the title screen to go over this information again.

And that's pretty much all you need to know about Sprite Shootout! Thanks for trying out my game; I hope you enjoy it!
